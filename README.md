# Chronometer
This class represents the main activity of the application. This README file explains the code snippets in the onCreate method of the MainActivity class.
This onCreate method contains the necessary steps to create and initialize the MainActivity class. Here are the explanations of these steps:

1. Definition of the data binding object: A binding variable of type ActivityMainBinding is defined. This object allows us to establish a connection with the elements in the XML file.

2. Inflating the ActivityMainBinding object and setting the root view: The binding object is created by inflating it with ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater), and the root view is set with setContentView(binding.root).

3. Definition of a variable to hold the stop time: A stopTime variable of type Long is defined, initially set to 0.

4. Click event for the Start button: The click event for the Start button is defined using binding.buttonStart?.setOnClickListener. The base time of the chronometer is set, the chronometer is started, and the view elements are updated.

5. Click event for the Pause button: The click event for the Pause button is defined using binding.buttonPause?.setOnClickListener. The stop time is calculated, the chronometer is stopped, and the view elements are updated.

6. Click event for the Reset button: The click event for the Reset button is defined using binding.buttonReset?.setOnClickListener. The base time of the chronometer is reset
